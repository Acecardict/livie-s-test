      less privileged girls in schools and communities across Kano State.

    <h3>How It All Started</h3>
    <!-- Short Preview -->
    <div id="about-preview">
      <p>
        All my life, I have always wanted to be involved in projects that support the girl child, projects that protect her dignity and put a genuine smile on her face. Growing up in Abuja, specifically Kuje, I noticed that many initiatives focused on girls already existed. While this was encouraging, I also observed that some people started NGOs simply because it was popular or for personal gain. I wanted something deeper—something driven by purpose, not trends.

      <p>
        Later, I moved to Zaria for my NCE, where I studied Special Education. During my time there, a question kept coming to my heart: Why not focus on girls with special needs? These girls are often overlooked, misunderstood, and excluded from conversations around care, dignity, and menstrual health. The idea stayed with me, but at the time, I had no money or capital to start anything. All I could do was plan, dream, and hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing my NCE in 2022, I decided to give myself time, trusting that the right moment would come. Still, nothing seemed to work out. In 2024, I gained admission into Bayero University, Kano, and that was when everything changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        One evening, outside my house, I met a young girl who was menstruating. She looked confused and uncomfortable. When I asked her what was wrong, she hesitated and then explained that she didn’t have sanitary pads. She was using a towel, and it was already overflowing. When I asked why she hadn’t told her parents, she said they couldn’t afford pads and that her mother also used cloth because they had to choose between buying food and buying pads. That moment broke something in me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I only had a small pack of pads with me, which I gave to her. I apologized for not having more and promised her that I would do better next time. That day, August 25th, I went back to my room feeling weak, emotional, and deeply stirred. But in that same moment, clarity came. Ideas began to flow. I realized that this was the sign I had been waiting for.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to finally start what had been in my heart for years: an initiative focused on the girl child, especially girls with special needs, combining care, dignity, education, and love. I refined my vision, crafted a plan, and took the first step no matter how small.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was how Livie's Care Initiative was born: out of compassion, lived experience, and a deep desire to ensure that no girl, especially one with special needs, is left behind or made to feel less human because of something as natural as menstruation.
